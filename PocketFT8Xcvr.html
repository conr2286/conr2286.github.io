<h2 class="western">DSP Audio Architecture</h2>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Decoding FT8
requires significant data storage and processing speed. In order to
optimize both program storage and processing speed requirements so
that the Teensy is not over taxed, the Teensy Audio Library has been
modified to allow Analog to Digital conversion to be run at the rate
of 6400 samples per second. This allows audio data processing to be
done at 3200 Hz. The 3200 Hz audio processing with a 2048 FTT to
process the received audio for FT8 decoding yields a bin spacing of
3.125 Hz. For Teensy 4.1, the revised sample rate required
replacement of the core AudioStream.h file with the AudioStream6400.h
file in the PocketFT8FW sketch folder.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">The algorithms
developed by Karlis Goba use the 3.125 Hz spaced FFT bins to be
screened in both frequency and time so that errors in symbol
frequency and time reception can be overcome to provide really great
FT8 decoding. The end spacing of the FT8 algorithms is 6.25 Hz.</p>
<h2 class="western">Motivation and Related Projects</h2>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">About 1966, the ARRL
Handbook published a receiver design known as the Junior Miser's
Dream that achieved so much with so little. Likewise, Charley Hill's
design for a self-contained FT8 transceiver, ideal for POTA/SOTA,
again achieves so much with so little. The entire transceiver fits in
a portable enclosure, and the power demand is acceptable for a USB
power block. Pocket FT8 Revisited V1.10 is a mostly faithful
re-implementation of Charley's concept with revisions largely limited
to those necessary for the Teensy 4.1. From there, the project has
and continues to implement enhancements to get just a little more
from so little.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Unlike the uSDX
multi-mode designs, Pocket FT8 focuses entirely on FT8. Yes, yes, I
know. That's why I have other radios. Pocket FT8 fits in the pocket
of my backpack, doesn't require an external key, microphone,
headphone, cell phone, or computer, and offers a completely
self-contained transceiver for a contest-like POTA/SOTA &quot;QSO.&quot;
It's clean.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">An alternative
approach, previously investigated as YASDR, is to construct an FT8
radio hat for a Raspberry 5 supporting the comprehensive wsjtx/etc
natively. This archived project offers considerable flexibility but
with higher power requirements (I'm getting too old to pack heavy
batteries in the mountains;). This approach is worth revisiting in
the future if we can get the power demand down.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Charley and Barb
have also progressed beyond the original Pocket FT8 with a multiband
FT8 transceiver, DX FT8, at
<a href="https://github.com/WB2CBA/DX-FT8-FT8-MULTIBAND-TABLET-TRANSCEIVER">https://github.com/WB2CBA/DX-FT8-FT8-MULTIBAND-TABLET-TRANSCEIVER</a>,
replacing the SI4735 with a Tayloe receiver.</p>
<h2 class="western">Versions and Status</h2>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">V1.00 PCB gerbers
and pos files submitted to PCBWay.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">V1.10 Transmitter
works. Receiver occasionally decodes FT8 messages. See Issue #23 on
github.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">V2.00 A new PCB
moves the SI5351 and MCP342x to away from Wire to Wire2 to minimize
I2C noise (Issue #23) hampering the SI4735. Status: As of Dec 4,
2024, this board is undergoing testing at KQ7B.</p>
<h2 class="western">Design Notes</h2>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Versions of Pocket
FT8 Revisited are tested on 40M and 20M at KQ7B.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">The receiver is
based upon the SI4735 chip offering a compact, low-power approach for
most HF bands Following-up on a tip from the SI4735's application
notes, the chip was found to be sensitive to noise from other I2C
traffic on the same bus as the SI4735. Disabling the touchscreen I2C
in firmware resolved the issue, greatly improving reception at the
loss of the GUI. The V2.00 boards address this issue by moving the
touchscreen (MCP342X) and SI5351 traffic from the Wire to the Wire2
I2C bus, isolating the SI4735 on Wire. Likewise, the revised boards
pay more attention to signal routing adjacent to noise-sensitive
circuitry.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Yes, it’s FT8
only; CW and SSB modes appear infeasible with this receiver. The
SI4735's PLL limits the receiver's tuning to 1 kHz steps which is
incompatible with amateur CW and SSB operation. If you need these
modes in a kit, check-out the <a href="https://qrp-labs.com/">QRP
Labs</a> transceivers; Hans does an awesome job.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">The V1.10
transmitter PA employed a MMIC a la Charles Hill's original design.
The V2.00 boards replaced the MMIC with Barb’s idea to use the
readily available SN74ACT244 line driver which also delivers a bit
more power (an idea borrowed from the DX FT8).</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Many clock designs
use a TCXO driving one of the SI5351's crystal pins and these designs
are often in conflict with the SI5351 application notes
recommendations. Following up on a tip re. phase noise with that
approach, this design employs a low jitter TCXO driving the SI5351's
CLKIN pin. Following up on yet another tip regarding the SI5351's
phase noise when driving heavy loads, the V2.00 boards buffer the
XCLK signal from the SI5351. All this may be overkill but it was easy
to implement.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">The V2.00 boards and
the original Pocket FT8 project use an external MCP342x ADC to poll
the touchscreen. With a non-blocking ADC library, the Teensy 4.1
could likely use its second internal ADC but this idea has not yet
been tested (it can be achieved using a patch to the V2.00 boards).
Alternative approaches include using a touchscreen controller.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Both the V1.10 and
V2.00 boards display occasional erratic touchscreen behavior. The
V2.00 bench testing process is currently (Dec 4, 2024) investigating
the root cause(s) of this issue. One finding is substantial impulse
noise on the X- and Y+ high impedance signals to the ADC. Potential
solutions include lowering the impedance to the ADC and/or low-pass
filtering of the high frequency noise. Issue #27 tracks the on-going
investigation.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">The V1.10 boards
employed a 5-pole Chebyshev LP filter providing a measured 40dB of
2nd harmonic rejection and excellent 3rd harmonic rejection of a
steady state (Tune) carrier. However, FT8 transmit/receive switching
produced a very brief but concerning 2nd harmonic burst. The root
cause has not yet been investigated, but the V2.00 boards are
designed to accept filter plugins allowing experimentation with
alternative filters (e.g. a harmonic trap) if the problem persists.
Issue #26 tracks this investigation.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">The V1.10 LP filter
lacked rejection of received signals below the operating frequency.
Investigations into the SI4735 performance found surprisingly strong
signals in the 540..7000 kHz range having the potential to limit the
receiver's performance. The V2.00 board filter plugins offer a chance
to explore a bandpass design to protect the receiver's front end. 
</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">The long-term goal
is to use a GPS to identify the operator's grid square and sync the
clock to UTC. The V2.00 boards support a GPS connection but no
firmware has been completed as yet.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">The touchscreen
circuitry is proving troublesome. While it walmost always works, its
occasional erratic performance is annoying. One of the project's
long-term goals is to better understand and resolve the issue with
hardware, firmware or both.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Logging was
originally done to an SD text file, but needs to migrate to an ADIF
file after the V2.00 hardware is up-and-running.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Use of a GPS to
acquire UTC time and grid square for logging is also envisioned after
the V2.00 boards (which include support for GPS) are up-and-running.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">The transceiver is
configured for your station using a config.json file on an SD card.</p>

FT8</a> kit as Pocket FT8 construction demands some engineering
skills and lab equipment. That said, I sometimes have a *very*
limited quantity of excess boards with most SMD components in-place
if you like to experiment. Alternatively, the KiCad files are
available as a starting point for your innovations.</p>
<h2 class="western">Refactoring</h2>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">When the issues list
shrinks a bit, I’ll likely migrate the firmware from the Arduino
IDE to PlatformIO to better support testing and isolating the project
code from the various libraries with their bug fixes and
enhancements.</p>
<h2 class="western">Motivation</h2>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">The 1966 edition of
the ARRL Handbook published a wonderful receiver known as the Junior
Miser’s Dream. Its elegant, no-frills, do-what-needs-to-be-done,
clean design (that could be constructed even by a junior high school
student) influenced my approach to radio design as well as computer
software. In the years since, amateur radio equipment has grown in
features and complexity as well as performance. Sure, I love my
Elecraft K3S; it does everything. But Charley’s Pocket FT8 is a
step back from all that, a step challenging us to achieve so-much
with so-little, a step questioning the essence of what do we really
need. In a POTA/SOTA rig, perhaps what we most need is, “it just
works.” -- KQ7B</p>
